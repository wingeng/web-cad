** change bounding box representation

right now it's a Rect() object.  Might be better to represent as an
array of two points.

pt-min, pt-max

** General parsing of numbers 

*** to modify the size/parameters of last object

**** In line: location of last point

** line tool

*** Edit line?

manually, via text box? select point and enter coordinates (in
inches, mm, )


** select tool

*** draw select box 

The select box is drawn if start of select is outside of any bounding
box of any rectangle.

Direction of selection determines mode of selecting objects.
left -> right directions means to select objects fully enclosed.

right -> left means select any objects that intersect with bounding box.
